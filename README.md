# NestJS Masterclass

This repository contains the code examples, exercises, and projects for the NestJS Masterclass.

## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and is heavily inspired by Angular, making it a great choice for developers familiar with Angular's architecture.

### Why NestJS?

If we have Node.js, why do we need NestJS? Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server side. However, it does not provide a structured way to build applications. NestJS fills this gap by providing a framework that encourages best practices, modular architecture, and dependency injection.

NestJS allows for scalable application development by providing features like:

- **Modularity**: Organize your code into modules for better maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Manage dependencies in a clean and efficient way.
- **TypeScript Support**: Leverage TypeScript's features for better code quality and developer experience.
- **Extensive Ecosystem**: Use a wide range of libraries and tools that integrate seamlessly with NestJS.

### Why do we need structured code?

Structured code is essential for several reasons:

- **Maintainability**: Well-structured code is easier to read, understand, and modify. It reduces complexity and makes it easier to onboard new developers.
- **Scalability**: As applications grow, structured code helps manage complexity and allows for easier scaling. It enables teams to work on different parts of the application without stepping on each other's toes
- **Testability**: Structured code is easier to test. It allows for better isolation of components, making unit testing and integration testing more straightforward.
- **Consistency**: A consistent code structure helps developers follow best practices and reduces the likelihood of bugs. It also makes it easier to enforce coding standards across the team.

### How does NestJS make this possible?

NestJS provides a modular architecture that encourages developers to organize their code into modules, controllers, and services. This structure promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to manage dependencies and maintain the codebase.

NestJS provides out-of-the-box features like routing, middleware, exception handling, testing, documentation, plugins, and more.

### Use Cases for NestJS

NestJS is suitable for a wide range of applications, including:

- **RESTful APIs**: Build robust and scalable APIs for web and mobile applications.
- **GraphQL APIs**: Create flexible and efficient APIs using GraphQL.
- **Microservices**: Develop distributed systems with ease, leveraging NestJS's built-in support for microservices architecture.
- **Real-time Applications**: Build real-time applications using WebSockets and other real-time protocols.
- **Serverless Applications**: Deploy NestJS applications on serverless platforms
- **Enterprise Applications**: Develop large-scale applications with complex business logic and requirements.
- **CLI Tools**: Create command-line tools and utilities using NestJS's CLI capabilities.
- **MVC Applications**: Build full-stack applications with a clear separation of concerns between the model, view, and controller layers.
